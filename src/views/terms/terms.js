                <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
                <p>
                  The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one
                  of the following applies: Users have given their consent for
                  one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations
                  the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the
                  User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to
                  rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases.
                  This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of
                  Personal Data is subject to European data protection law; -
                  provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an
                  agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual
                  obligations thereof; - processing is necessary for compliance
                  with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject; -
                  processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
                  public interest or in the exercise of official authority
                  vested in the Owner; - processing is necessary for the
                  purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or
                  by a third party. In any case, the Owner will gladly help to
                  clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
                  processing, and in particular whether the provision of
                  Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a
                  requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
                </p>
                <h3>Place</h3>
                <p>
                  The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in
                  any other places where the parties involved in the processing
                  are located. Depending on the User's location, data transfers
                  may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other
                  than their own. To find out more about the place of processing
                  of such transferred Data, Users can check the section
                  containing details about the processing of Personal Data.
                  Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data
                  transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any
                  international organization governed by public international
                  law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and
                  about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard
                  their Data. If any such transfer takes place, Users can find
                  out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or
                  inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the
                  contact section.
                </p>
                <h3>Retention time</h3>
                <p>
                  Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as
                  required by the purpose they have been collected for.
                  Therefore: Personal Data collected for purposes related to the
                  performance of a contract between the Owner and the User shall
                  be retained until such contract has been fully performed.

                  regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within
                  the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the
                  Owner. The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a
                  longer period whenever the User has given consent to such
                  processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn.
                  Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data
                  for a longer period whenever required to do so for the
                  performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an
                  authority. Once the retention period expires, Personal Data
                  shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to
                  erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data
                  portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the
                  retention period.

                  to restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the
                  Owner will not process their Data for any purpose other than
                  storing it. Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise
                  removed. Users have the right, under certain circumstances, to
                  obtain the erasure of their Data from the Owner. Receive their
                  Data and have it transferred to another controller. Users have
                  the right to receive their Data in a structured, commonly used
                  and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to
                  have it transmitted to another controller without any
                  hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that the Data
                  is processed by automated means and that the processing is
                  based on the User's consent, on a contract which the User is
                  part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof. Lodge a
                  complaint. Users have the right to bring a claim before their
                  competent data protection authority.
